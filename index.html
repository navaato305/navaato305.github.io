            <p id="desc">I grew up in Miami, Florida learning music and using computers and other technologeis. From the third grade to twelfth I was in the band a orchestra playing upright bass. I applied for All State in seventh grade, which is a national music competition where only the best get in, and got accepted and continued to attend for the  next five years.<br> <br>I've always been fast at picking up technology and interested in learning more about it, so I began teaching myself how to understand troubleshooting for PC and then for internet routers. Only recently did I start to learn to program and immerse myself in this new world of tech.<br><br> Currently I'm taking a programming bootcamp course that will teach me all about front end and back end development. I have tried before to learn by myself, but unfortunately I couldn't learn very well on my own and am very much looking forward to this class so I can finally understand everything that I've wanted to.</p>
